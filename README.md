# MUSA5000 Homework 1: Using OLS Regression to Predict Median House Values in Philadelphia

This assignment asks you to examine the relationship between median house values and several neighborhood characteristics, using Philadelphia data at the Census block group level. You will need R for this assignment. Remember that this report needs to be written with an introduction, methods/results, and discussion. Pointers for a successful report, as well as an example on how to interpret regression output, are included. Also included is an outline which you’re asked to follow when writing your report. 

## REPORT OUTLINE

**Please refer to HW1 Instructions and Outline**

A successful report will address the points presented in this outline. You are strongly encouraged to use the outline as a backbone for your report. 

Note that this outline separates the Methods and Results sections. If you prefer to combine them, that is certainly fine as well – however, be sure to address every point in this outline. 

The outline here is structured as an outline for a journal article. That is, in the Methods section, only talk about the techniques that you use, present the formulas, etc. Do not present any results in the methods section. In the Results section, actually present the output from R, any figures/screenshots, etc, and describe your output
