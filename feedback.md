This is a really stellar submission. Your score is 104.

A few comments:
1. We use log with base of e, rather than 10. Unfortunately, as I mention in my slides, statisticians are very sloppy about notation and use log when they actually mean ln.

2. "The coefficient represent the change in the log-transformed median house value for a one-unit change in the corresponding predictor, holding other predictors constant. " As you know, there are different ways to interpret this when variables are log-transformed (especially when the predictors are logged as well)

3. "H0 states that the coefficient for the predictor i is equal to zero, meaning that the predictor does not explain the variance in the dependent variable (median house value)." Specifically, we test the hypothesis about a beta coefficient (amount by which y changes when x increases by 1 unit), rather than the R-squared associated with the predictor (variance). They're related, but not the same.

4. "As seen in the plots, all key variables exhibit left-skewness, meaning their distributions are right-skewed (positively skewed)" Not sure what this means. The original variables are right-skewed, not left-skewed (the long tail is on the right). After the transformations, the distribution of the PCT variables remain zero-inflated, which is why we use the original variables.

Great job on interpreting regression coefficients! For the ANOVA table, there are several types of sums of squares, and there's a document on Canvas going over them and how to interpret them.

I think that your visual conclusions about normality and homoscedasticity are reasonable, but as you will see in HW 2, when we do hypothesis tests, we will conclude that residuals are neither normal nor heteroscedastic.

+5 for the excellent write up and all the extras.
